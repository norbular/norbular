## `📘` `About Norbular`
Norwegian verbs changes depending on the tense. Regular verbs have similar rules of how verbs change, 
but irregular ones have to be memorized somehow, because there are no actual rules of how verbs change.
[Anafro.Norbular](https://norbular.anafro.ru/) is a free online learning platform for memorizing Norwegian
irregular verbs. 

All the verbs are divided into sets of verbs. Click on a card to start learning 4-5 verbs of the set.
It shows all the verbs in all the forms. Write the verb depending on the form provided! 

## `▶️` `Deployment`
Just clone the repository. Since the platform is web-based, open the `index.html` to access the platform.
